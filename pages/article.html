                        Sec. 225 of the Act shall be complied with.

                        18.7 The remuneration of the auditor or auditors shall be fixed by the Association in general
                        meeting except that the remuneration of any auditor or auditors appointed by the Executive
                        Committee to fill a casual
                        vacancy may be fixed by the Committee.
